    <h1> ABOUT ME</h1>
    <div class="body">
    <p>My name is Rhythm Agarwalla. I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science from Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology. I have completed my high school diploma fron Central Academy, Kota. Till class 10th I was in the Scindia School, Gwalior, after which I transfered to Central Academy. I am a very simple and honest person if you talk to me in general. I generally prefer the other person approaching to start a conversation. I am quiet shy to do so. But, when it comes to professional or my work, I am one of the most confident guy around. I am someone who gives forward my opinion and is very onpen about it to. I'm also a confident leader and a good team player. I am really intrested in football and stays up to date with what's happening in the football world. Other than football, I also follow cricket. I myself is also an artist and looks for creative work. I feel I am also one of the best critics around. The hilights of my life has been the friends I have made on my way (they are few but they are the best). I am a fun loving person at heart and my weekness is that  I am a little lazy and I overthink quiet a lot.
